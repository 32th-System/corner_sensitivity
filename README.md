# th_corner_sensitivity: Adjust joystick corner sensitivity for any game that uses XInput
th17 has a problem where the game is too sensitive on what it considers a corner on a joystick. Older Touhou games didn't have this project

Put `th_corner_sensitivity.dll` into your thcrap `bin` folder. Once you run a game that uses XInput, such as th17 or th18, `th_corner_sensitivity` will apprear in `config` in your thcrap folder. This is where you can change settings
